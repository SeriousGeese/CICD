// Non-throwing temp-directory removal for the node:test suites here. A test helper, vendored
// with the suites that import it.
//
// The distinction this encodes, and the reason it is not just `try {} catch {}`
// inline everywhere:
//
//   * Failing to remove a scratch directory is NOT a product defect. It means a
//     process outside our control is still holding a handle to it. On Windows
//     that is routine and documented: `dolt push` leaves a detached telemetry
//     process holding `.dolt/eventsData/dolt.lock` for up to ~15-20s,
//     and `ensure-worktree-deps.mjs` deliberately
//     spawns its installer detached. Letting that EPERM fail the suite reports
//     a lock contention as a code failure.
//
//   * But it must never be SILENT. A leaked temp dir is worth knowing about,
//     and a swallowed error is exactly how the next leaked-directory mystery
//     gets built. So every failure prints a loud, tagged, self-explaining line
//     naming the directory and the reason.
//
//   * And it must never THROW OUT OF A `finally`. Several suites call cleanup
//     from a `finally` guarding a real assertion; a throw there replaces the
//     assertion's message with an EPERM and destroys the actual diagnosis.
//
// Deliberately NOT used by the hook suites that build fake `.git` marker files
// and nothing else (block-primary-checkout-edits, block-worktree-branch-switch).
// Those directories contain only plain files this process wrote, no child
// process ever touches them, and nothing can hold a lock on them — so a removal
// failure there really would be surprising and SHOULD fail loudly as an error.

import fs from 'node:fs';

// Only these codes mean "something still holds a handle / the OS will not let go yet".
// EPERM, EBUSY and ENOTEMPTY are the Windows spellings (a live better-sqlite3 handle, a detached
// child, an AV scan); EACCES is the POSIX spelling of the same consequence. Anything else (EIO,
// ENOSPC, EINVAL, a TypeError from a bad argument) is a real fault and is rethrown.

/**
 * Close every better-sqlite3 handle that is still open; ignores undefined/null and handles a
 * test already closed. Call it in a `finally` BEFORE removeTempDir: a test that fails on an
 * assertion leaves its handle open, and on Windows an open handle makes the directory removal
 * fail with EPERM.
 *
 * Never throws: better-sqlite3 refuses to close while a statement cursor (`.iterate()`) is
 * mid-flight ("connection is busy"), which is exactly the state a failed assertion leaves
 * behind, and a throw out of a `finally` would replace that assertion. A failed close is
 * reported (the same `[cleanup]` format as removeTempDir) and the remaining handles are still
 * closed.
